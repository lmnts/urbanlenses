# LMNts Urban Lenses

This repository is a collection of urban analysis tools developed by LMNts, designed to highlight both tangible and intangible aspects of the city. While certain city systems can be easily mapped due to their visible and comprehensible nature, there are other influential data types that are less tangible, yet equally critical. Recognizing these unseen elements enables us to discover and interpret the city in new ways.

These fresh perspectives generate a comprehensive and nuanced picture of the urban landscape. They provide valuable insights that inform our approach when embarking on a design project, facilitating a seamless integration of our work with the existing urban environment.

Viewed as a collective whole, these tools embody our unique approach to urban design. They represent our inquisitiveness, shedding light on our perspectives and ambitions, as we strive to connect and contribute meaningfully to the urban tapestry through thoughtful design
